# Task
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of  followed by  lines of commands where each command will be of the  7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

# Example
 N=4
 Append 1
 Apeend 2
 insert 1 3
 Print
Append 1 : Append  to the list, .
Apeend 2 : Append  to the list, .
insert 1 3 : Insert  at index , .
Print : Print the array.

# Output:-
[1, 3, 2]

# Input Format:-
The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of commands.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

# Constraints :-
The elements added to the list must be integers.

# Output Format:-
For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.

# Sample Input :-
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print

# Sample Output:-
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]

### SOLUTION ###

lst = []
N = int(input())

for _ in range(N):
    command = input().split()
    cmd = command[0]

    if cmd == "insert":
        i = int(command[1])
        e = int(command[2])
        lst.insert(i, e)

    elif cmd == "print":
        print(lst)

    elif cmd == "remove":
        e = int(command[1])
        lst.remove(e)

    elif cmd == "append":
        e = int(command[1])
        lst.append(e)

    elif cmd == "sort":
        lst.sort()

    elif cmd == "pop":
        lst.pop()

    elif cmd == "reverse":
        lst.reverse()
